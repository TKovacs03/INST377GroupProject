<!---Current design ideas -

    Important - how will we load user data? Ask for username on load?

    Search bar is basic on main page, but links to dedicated search result page with filtering options
    Maybe no popular/reccommended section - only way to get that information is from our own database, which will only have our info
    Do randomized genre +random selection of books instead,  dynamically load personalized stuff from database
    Will likely need revision, I don't really know what is possible with Supabase
    Use a library to display book covers, some sort of carousel
    Need one more library
